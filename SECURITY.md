# Security

This document describes the security properties of the MongrelDB Kotlin/Native
client and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Overview

The MongrelDB Kotlin/Native client is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that
compiles to native machine code (no JVM). In HTTP mode it talks to
`mongreldb-server` over HTTP using ktor-client-curl (which wraps libcurl). In
native mode it links `libmongreldb_kit` + `libmongreldb` directly and runs the
engine in-process. The client itself holds no encryption keys and stores no
data at rest; in HTTP mode it is a thin request/response layer over the daemon.

## Client security properties

- The client communicates with `mongreldb-server` over plain HTTP. The
  daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` by default - traffic stays on the loopback
  interface. For remote or multi-tenant deployments, terminate TLS in a
  reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) in front of the daemon.
- The client supports Bearer token and HTTP Basic auth, matching the
  daemon's `--auth-token` and `--auth-users` modes. Credentials are sent
  only in the `Authorization` header and are never logged by the client.
  The HTTP Basic encoder is implemented inline (Kotlin/Native has no
  `java.util.Base64`); it produces a standard RFC 7617 header value.
- The native condition API and query builder accept typed parameters
  (`Value` sealed class, `Column` ids, typed `Condition` subtypes) - no
  string interpolation, no SQL injection surface. User-supplied values are
  serialized as typed JSON by kotlinx.serialization, not concatenated into
  queries.
- **WARNING - raw SQL:** The `sql()` method sends a raw SQL string to the
  server. It does NOT parameterize or sanitize input, and the client never
  interprets SQL locally. Never interpolate untrusted user input into SQL
  statements - use parameterized queries where the server supports them, or
  validate/escape input yourself. (The native condition API and query
  builder remain type-safe and are not affected.)
- Idempotency keys are caller-supplied opaque strings; the client does not
  derive or store them.
- JSON decoding uses kotlinx.serialization with `ignoreUnknownKeys = true`,
  so additive server responses do not expose unsafe parsing paths.
  Malformed JSON surfaces as a `QueryException` rather than undefined
  behavior.
- All native FFI handles (`mongreldb_kit_database_t`, returned JSON/Arrow
  buffers) are freed through the matching `mongreldb_kit_*_free` call inside
  a `memScoped` block; there are no caller-side free obligations that could
  be missed. `NativeDB` implements `AutoCloseable`.
- Memory management is Kotlin/Native's default (ARC). The client owns the
  ktor `HttpClient` and releases it on `close()`.

## Daemon security (mongreldb-server)

The client is a consumer of `mongreldb-server`. The daemon's security
posture:

- Binds to `127.0.0.1` only - not accessible from other machines.
- **No authentication by default** - any local process can query, write, or
  delete data. Enable `--auth-token` or `--auth-users` for any shared host.
- No TLS - traffic is plaintext on the loopback interface.
- No rate limiting or request size caps.

For remote access or multi-tenant environments, place a reverse proxy
(nginx, Caddy) in front with TLS termination and authentication. Do not
expose the daemon directly to a network.

## Native embedded security

When you link `libmongreldb_kit` + `libmongreldb` directly (the
`-PenableNative=true` mode), the engine runs in your process. The same
engine that powers `mongreldb-server` executes your SQL, migrations, and
queries with full filesystem access to the database directory you pass to
`NativeDB.open` / `NativeDB.create`. Treat the database directory with the
same care as any local data store.

- `NativeDB` is single-threaded (Kotlin/Native `Rc<RefCell>`). Create one
  per worker; do not share across threads.
- SQL passed to `sqlRows` / `sqlArrow` is raw and unparameterized - the
  same WARNING about interpolating untrusted input applies.
- Migration JSON is trusted input. Do not run migrations from untrusted
  sources; they execute arbitrary `raw_sql`.

## Input validation

- The query builder produces typed JSON requests. Invalid column ids, value
  encodings, and numeric ranges are serialized as typed JSON, not
  concatenated strings.
- Server and network errors are mapped to the typed exception hierarchy
  (`AuthException`, `NotFoundException`, `ConflictException`,
  `QueryException`), not leaked as generic failures. See [errors.md](docs/errors.md).

## Dependency security

The MongrelDB Kotlin/Native client has these runtime dependencies:

- **ktor-client-curl** (which wraps **libcurl**) for HTTP.
- **kotlinx-serialization-json** for the wire format.
- The Kotlin/Native runtime and standard library.

Keep libcurl patched via your system package manager. For native mode, keep
`libmongreldb` + `libmongreldb_kit` current with the
[MongrelDB releases](https://github.com/visorcraft/MongrelDB/releases).
Report dependency vulnerabilities through GitHub's Dependabot alerts or the
private vulnerability reporting flow below.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not file a public GitHub issue, discussion, or pull request for
security problems.** Report privately through **GitHub's private
vulnerability reporting**:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Fill in the advisory form with the details below.

This keeps the report confidential between you and the maintainers
until a fix is ready. Please include as much as you can:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- step-by-step reproduction steps,
- the MongrelDB Kotlin/Native client version, Kotlin toolchain version,
  Gradle version, OS, and native target,
- the `mongreldb-server` version (HTTP mode) or `libmongreldb` /
  `libmongreldb_kit` version (native mode) if relevant,
- the relevant configuration, error output, or a proof-of-concept,
- a suggested fix or mitigation, if you have one.

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement** of your report within a few days.
- An initial assessment and, where confirmed, a remediation plan.
- Progress updates through the private advisory thread until the
  issue is resolved.
- Credit for your responsible disclosure in the advisory, unless you
  prefer to remain anonymous.

We ask that you give us a reasonable opportunity to ship a fix before
any public disclosure.
