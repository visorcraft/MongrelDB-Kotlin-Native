# SQL

MongrelDB ships a DataFusion-backed SQL engine at `POST /sql`. From Kotlin, run
SQL with `sql`:

```kotlin
val body = db.sql("SELECT 1")
```

This guide covers the SQL surface - DDL, DML, `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`,
recursive CTEs, and window functions - and when to reach for SQL versus the
native query builder.

---

## How `sql` behaves

`db.sql(statement)` sends `{"format": "json", "sql": "..."}` to `/sql`. It
returns the raw response body as a `String` (the client never interprets the
SQL locally).

In practice:

- **DDL and DML** (`CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) reply with a
  non-JSON status body. Success is the signal - no exception is thrown on a
  2xx response.
- **`SELECT`** in most daemon builds streams Arrow IPC bytes rather than JSON,
  even though the client requests `format=json`. Use the native `query` for
  typed row retrieval in application code, and use `sql` for statements whose
  execution is the goal (DDL/DML/admin).

Errors are mapped to the same exception hierarchy as everything else: an HTTP
400 or 5xx is a `QueryException`; 409 is a `ConflictException`; and so on. See
[errors.md](errors.md).

```kotlin
try {
    db.sql("INSERT INTO orders (id, customer, amount) VALUES (99, 'Zoe', 999.0)")
} catch (e: ConflictException) {
    System.err.println("duplicate row: ${e.message}")
}
```

**WARNING:** the SQL string is sent as-is to the server. It does NOT
parameterize or sanitize input. Never interpolate untrusted user input.

## CREATE TABLE

Define a table in SQL instead of via `createTable`. Column ids are assigned by
the server when not stated.

```kotlin
db.sql(
    """
    CREATE TABLE products (
      id INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR,
      price FLOAT64,
      category VARCHAR,
      in_stock BOOLEAN
    )
    """.trimIndent()
)
```

## INSERT

```kotlin
db.sql("INSERT INTO products (id, name, price, category, in_stock) VALUES (1, 'Widget', 9.99, 'tools', true)")
db.sql("INSERT INTO products VALUES (2, 'Gadget', 19.99, 'tools', true)")
```

For bulk inserts, the native batch transaction (`commit`) is usually faster
because it stages ops in one round trip without re-parsing SQL.

## UPDATE

```kotlin
db.sql("UPDATE products SET price = 14.99 WHERE id = 1")
db.sql("UPDATE orders SET amount = 200.0 WHERE customer = 'Bob'")
```

## DELETE

```kotlin
db.sql("DELETE FROM products WHERE in_stock = false")
db.sql("DELETE FROM products WHERE id = 2")
```

## SELECT

```kotlin
db.sql("SELECT id, name FROM products WHERE category = 'tools' ORDER BY price")
db.sql("SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS n FROM products GROUP BY category")
```

Remember SELECT bodies may arrive as Arrow IPC, so `sql` returns the raw body.
To read rows back into typed values, mirror the same lookup with `query`.

## CREATE TABLE AS SELECT

Materialize a query result into a new table. Great for snapshots, rollups, and
denormalized aggregates.

```kotlin
// Snapshot all high-value orders into a new table.
db.sql("CREATE TABLE archive AS SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 500")

// Roll up sales by customer.
db.sql(
    "CREATE TABLE sales_by_customer AS " +
    "SELECT customer, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY customer"
)
```

The new table inherits column types from the query. Query it afterward with
the native builder or SQL.

## Recursive CTEs

`WITH RECURSIVE` is fully supported. Classic use cases: series generation,
hierarchy/graph traversal.

```kotlin
// Generate the numbers 1..10.
db.sql(
    "WITH RECURSIVE r(n) AS (" +
    "  SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT n + 1 FROM r WHERE n < 10" +
    ") SELECT n FROM r"
)
```

A common practical example is walking an adjacency list:

```kotlin
db.sql(
    "WITH RECURSIVE descendants(id) AS (" +
    "  SELECT id FROM categories WHERE id = 1" +
    "  UNION ALL" +
    "  SELECT c.id FROM categories c JOIN descendants d ON c.parent_id = d.id" +
    ") SELECT id FROM descendants"
)
```

## Window functions

Window functions compute aggregates/rankings across a moving window without
collapsing rows. Useful for top-N-per-group, running totals, and row numbers.

```kotlin
// Row number within each customer, ordered by amount descending.
db.sql(
    "SELECT id, customer, amount, " +
    "ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rn " +
    "FROM orders"
)

// Running total per customer.
db.sql(
    "SELECT id, customer, amount, " +
    "SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer ORDER BY id) AS running_total " +
    "FROM orders"
)
```

`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `NTILE()`, and the usual
window-frame clauses are available through DataFusion.

## When to use SQL vs. the query builder

Both read from the same tables, but they are optimized for different jobs.

| Reach for | When |
|-----------|------|
| **`query`** | Point lookups, range scans, bitmap filters, and full-text that map to a native index. Sub-millisecond, no parser overhead, and rows decode into typed `Value` directly. |
| **SQL** | DDL (`CREATE TABLE`, schemas, materialized views), multi-statement setup, joins, recursive CTEs, window functions, and arbitrary aggregates. Also the natural choice for admin scripts and one-off analysis. |

Rules of thumb:

- Need typed rows of matching values? Use the query builder.
- Building/dropping tables, or running a `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`? Use SQL.
- Joining multiple tables, computing rankings, or walking a graph? Use SQL.
- Filtering by one or more indexed columns? Use the query builder - it is
  faster and avoids Arrow-to-value decoding.

Mix freely: create tables with SQL, write rows with `put`, read them back with
`query`, and run analytics with SQL.
